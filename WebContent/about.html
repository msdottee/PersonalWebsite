<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I am currently 27 years old. My day of birth falls on August 6, 1992. That's a Thursday if you were wondering. 
I was born at Detroit Sinai Hospital and raised in Livonia. I graduated from Franklin Highschool in 2010. 
After that I attended Schoolcraft college for 2 years and received an associates degree before moving on to Central Michigan University.
In 2016 I received my bachelors degree in meteorology and went on to work at the Oakland County Airport as one of their weather observers.
I worked at the airport for about 3 1/2 years before leaving to embark on a new journey of software development and that leads us to today.</p>
