		<h3>Hobby</h3>
		<p>In my free time I enjoy playing videogames. My first gaming
			console was Super Nintendo. I would play Mario World all the time and
			I was never very good at it, but I kept trying. Once the PlayStation
			came out my brother just had to have it. He would never let me touch
			it, but little does he know I would sneak into his room when he was
			out playing with friends and play Frogger. That game is one of my all
			time favorites. Next was the PS2 with DDR. I played that game so much
			I would go through dance pads like they were tissue paper. Gaming
			systems and games themselves developed so quickly it was hard to keep
			up, especially if you didn't have a lot of money. Finally, in
			sophomore or junior year of high school I was able to buy my first
			computer and I've been a PC gamer ever since. Currently I am an avid
			League of Legends player.</p>
