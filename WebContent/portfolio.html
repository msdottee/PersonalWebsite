		<p>Over the past 4 weeks I have been developing my skills to
			become a Java developer through Grand Circus. It has posed a few
			challenges, but it is all worth it. I could have never guessed that
			in such a short amount of time I would have so much to be proud of.
			Below I have posted a few of my projects that I think really stand
			out.</p>
		<h3>Movie Application</h3>
		<p>
			If you follow this <a
				href="https://github.com/msdottee/Lab11/tree/master/src/lab11">link</a>
			it will take you to my code for a movie application. In the
			application I was able to present the user with a list of movie genre
			options. When they picked what genre they wanted I printed out a list
			of movie titles for them in alphabetical order that matched the genre
			they picked. I incorporated a list with 100 movies in it.
		</p>
		<h4>Library Terminal</h4>
		<p>
			If you follow this <a href="https://github.com/NickyB37/MIdterm">link</a>
			it will take you to my group midterm project where we created a
			library terminal. We were able to incorporate a GUI for the user to
			use. In this GUI you could view all of the media we had to offer in
			the library, search a specific title or author/director, checkout and
			return items to the library, and if your heart desired you could
			donate a book or movie to the library.
